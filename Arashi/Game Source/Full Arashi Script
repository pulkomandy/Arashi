For a certain level, onlythose definitions that appear before the next greater 'level'statement will be used to define that level.Order of evaluation is unspecified and there are no guaranteesthat variables will have reasonable values unless they areinitialized. If a circular reference is encountered, an oldvalue of a looped variable will be used to get out of the loop.For instance:	a = b	b = a + 1	If we evaluate a, we usually get 1 on the first round. This isbecause most variables are initialized to 0. If we execute itagain, we get 2 etc. If, instead we evaluate b, we get 1, butthe value of a will be 0. I hope this is confusing enough sothat you will avoid circular references. Let's just say thatthey are not very useful, but they do not cause problems.The order of evaluation is on a "need to know basis". I guessit's called intelligent recalculation in spreadsheet programs.Let's look at it with a short example:	a = 10	b = a + 20	c = 30	d = b + a	If we then evaluate d, the system will try to evaluate b, noticethat b requires a to be defined, so it evaluates a and then b. Itthen sees a again, but notices that it has been evaluated alreadyand uses the old value. c does not get evaluated at all.Let's look at something more complicated:	level 1			b = a		a = 1		a = 2	level 16			a = 3From levels 1 to 15, b will evaluate to 2, because that's the lastdefinition of a. From level 16, the value of b will be 3.The definition a = 1 is not used at all, although it does get compiledbefore the next line replaces it.To actually define a game level, you have to define variables that ofinterest to the game. These variables are introduced in a prescriptresource. Feel free to peek at that resource to see what variables areavailable [during development, the prescript might be empty and theArashi Script file could contain everything].Variables that are prefixed with an 'i' are by convention internalvariables. In the next part of the prescript, these variables areconnected with variables that you should use. For instance, we haveiFlipperCount and FlipperCount. You should use FlipperCount even thoughiFlipperCount is really the variable that the game wants. This conventionallows us to scale or limit the values that can be set. For instance,we should probably limit FlipperCount to a minimum of 0.*/
